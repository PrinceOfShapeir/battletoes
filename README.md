To play, first click "load ai" at the top left. Please be patient as the ai loads. After this it will be cached and you can play as needed. If you mess up you may click the "reset" button at any time. 

The game ai learns from its mistakes. While the brain is saved in the browser, you may want to download it to continue training your ai player elsewhere. You can also theoretically upload any perceptron network in the synaptic.js format provided it has nine input neurons and one output. Hold on to your trained AIs, there will be a tournament coming soon.
